# Geoprocessing Tutorial

I intend to create tutorials for geoprocessing in this repository. At the moment I am focusing on using Python libraries for geoprocessing. I will be adding more tutorials as I learn more about Python and geoprocessing.

There won't be any source code in this repository, therefore I will have all the functions and code in the respective notebooks concerning the topic of geoprocessing I am working on.

## Current Topics

Topics can be found in the folder `tutorials`. The topics are:

1. [General Geoprocessing with Python]()
